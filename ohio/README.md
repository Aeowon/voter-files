# Ohio voter file

## Notes:

- Past party affiliation is not available, but the voter history includes whether the individual voted or not in past primaries, and in which ones, which could be used as measure of previous party affiliation instead. (I stored this in the past party affiliation variables.)
- `birth_date` in 'MM/DD/YYYY' format
- `gender` is not available
